# Modern C++ Learning Journey

This directory contains code and resources for my journey in learning modern C++ programming. It is intended as a personal space to practice, experiment, and document my progress with C++ concepts, syntax, and best practices.

## Purpose

- To explore and understand modern C++ features (C++11 and beyond).
- To write, compile, and run C++ code examples and exercises.
- To document key learnings, code snippets, and useful references.

## Structure

- `hello.cpp`: Example C++ source file.
- `source.exe`: Compiled executable (output of building C++ source files).
